# Cursor AI Project Rules

You have access to valid project context in the following files. You should prioritize reading these files to understand the project structure, configuration, and current state before proposing changes or answering complex questions:

1. **`.claude/CLAUDE.md`**: Contains AI development rules, coding conventions, and project overview. Read this first.
2. **`PROJECT_CONTEXT.md`**: Contains detailed architecture documentation, terminology, and design decisions.
3. **`docs/`**: Contains architecture documentation for Routing, API, Auth, Session, Socket, and Sync systems.
4. **`config.ts`**: Contains the main application configuration constants and types.
5. **`.env`**: Contains environment variables and active configuration settings.

## Behavior
- When starting a significant task, always check `.claude/CLAUDE.md` and `PROJECT_CONTEXT.md` first.
- Verify configuration values in `config.ts` and `.env` when debugging or adding features.
- Follow all rules defined in `.claude/CLAUDE.md` (styling, error handling, comments, SOLID, etc.).

## Context Update Rule (IMPORTANT)
**After every code change, you MUST:**
1. **Update `PROJECT_CONTEXT.md`** - Document any new files, functions, patterns, or behavior changes you've made. Keep the documentation in sync with the codebase.
2. **Regenerate `repomix-output.xml`** - Run `npx repomix` to regenerate the codebase summary with your changes.

This ensures future AI sessions have accurate context about the current state of the codebase.


## Files for extra context
**These files are meant for the user but can be usefull for the AI to understand the project**
1. `docs/ARCHITECTURE_API.md`
2. `docs/ARCHITECTURE_AUTH.md`
3. `docs/ARCHITECTURE_SESSION.md`
4. `docs/ARCHITECTURE_SOCKET.md`
5. `docs/ARCHITECTURE_SYNC.md`
6. `docs/DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md`

After changes are made all files can be updated if they are related to the changes.
