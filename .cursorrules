# Cursor AI Project Rules

You have access to valid project context in the following files. You should prioritize reading these files to understand the project structure, configuration, and current state before proposing changes or answering complex questions:

1. **`.claude/CLAUDE.md`**: Contains AI development rules, coding conventions, and project overview. Read this first.
2. **`PROJECT_CONTEXT.md`**: Contains detailed architecture documentation, terminology, and design decisions.
3. **`docs/`**: Contains architecture documentation for Routing, API, Auth, Session, Socket, and Sync systems.
4. **`config.ts`**: Contains the main application configuration constants and types.
5. **`.env`**: Contains environment variables and active configuration settings.

## Behavior
- When starting a significant task, always check `.claude/CLAUDE.md` and `PROJECT_CONTEXT.md` first.
- Verify configuration values in `config.ts` and `.env` when debugging or adding features.
- Follow all rules defined in `.claude/CLAUDE.md` (styling, error handling, comments, SOLID, etc.).

## Context Update Rule (IMPORTANT)
**After every significant code change, you MUST:**
1. **Update `PROJECT_CONTEXT.md`** - Document any new files, functions, patterns, or behavior changes. Keep the documentation in sync with the codebase.
2. **Tell the user to run `npx repomix`** - To regenerate the codebase summary with your changes.
