## When this applies

Only when you run **more than one backend instance** (behind `@luckystack/router` or any
load balancer). A single-instance deploy sidesteps every pitfall below — the Redis adapter
is attached but has no peers, and all sockets live in one process.

## Mental model

```
                         ┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
   browser / client ───► │  @luckystack/router  (npm run router) │  load balancer, :4000
                         └───────────────┬─────────────────────┘
            HTTP /api/<service>/...      │   WS /socket.io/  (pinned to `system`)
                         ┌───────────────┴───────────────┐
                         ▼                                ▼
              backend "core-preset"            backend "fleet-preset"
              owns service `system`            owns service `vehicles`
                         │                                │
                         └──────────► shared Redis ◄───────┘
                              (@socket.io/redis-adapter pub/sub)
```

Two config files drive it:
- **`services.config.ts`** — which services exist and how they group into **presets**
  (one backend bundle = one preset). `system` is reserved (`source: 'root'` = `src/_api` +
  `src/_sync`).
- **`deploy.config.ts`** — per environment, a **single URL binding per service**
  (`bindings: { system: 'http://localhost:4100' }`). The router resolves
  `/api/vehicles/getAll` → service `vehicles` → that env's `vehicles` binding (local if owned
  + healthy, else the `fallback` env, else `502 serviceNotAssigned`). See
  `packages/router/src/resolveTarget.ts`.

Run a backend per preset: `npm run server -- core-preset 4100`. Run the router:
`npm run router` (port 4000, or `ROUTER_PORT`).

---

## Sockets across instances — the part that surprises people

**All WebSocket upgrades are pinned to the `system` service** by convention
(`packages/router/src/wsProxy.ts:13`). So every socket — and therefore every sync/socket
**handler** — runs on whichever `system`-service backend holds that client's connection.
Handler location is **not** configurable per route; it follows the socket.

Cross-instance reach is provided by **`@socket.io/redis-adapter`**, attached unconditionally
on every backend (`packages/core/src/socketRedisAdapter.ts`, wired at
`packages/server/src/loadSocket.ts:115`). Two mechanisms ride on it:
- `io.to(room).emit(...)` — used by the streaming emitters — publishes to Redis so a broadcast
  reaches that room's sockets on every instance.
- `io.in(room).fetchSockets()` — used by the regular `syncRequest` fan-out — enumerates the
  room's members across **all** instances (`RemoteSocket[]`); per-recipient delivery then routes
  to each via `RemoteSocket.emit()`.

### Which sync primitives cross instances?

| Primitive | Crosses instances? | Mechanism |
|---|---|---|
| `stream(payload)` | n/a — originator only | unicast back to the requesting socket |
| `broadcastStream(payload)` | ✅ **YES** | `io.to(room).emit()` → Redis adapter (`streamEmitters.ts:217`) |
| `streamTo(tokens, payload)` | ✅ **YES** | `io.to(tokens).emit()` → Redis adapter (`streamEmitters.ts:237`) |
| **regular `syncRequest` fan-out** (the `_server` result + optional per-recipient `_client`) | ✅ **YES** | `io.in(room).fetchSockets()` (cross-instance enumeration) + per-recipient `RemoteSocket.emit()` (`handleSyncRequest.ts`) |

### Regular sync vs the streaming emitters — different jobs, not two ways to do one thing

`syncRequest` + `upsertSyncEventCallback` is the **one** function for a normal request→fan-out
sync. It runs `_server` once, optionally runs a per-recipient `_client` (which can return a
*different* `clientOutput` per recipient — filtering, translation, per-user branding), and
delivers the final result to every room member **across all instances**.

The streaming emitters (`stream` / `broadcastStream` / `streamTo`) are a **separate feature** for
**live multi-chunk streaming** (LLM tokens, collab diffs) — many small emits over time. They are
server-side parameters you call *inside* `_server`, not separate client functions. There are
three because a stream can target three audiences: just the originator (`stream`), the whole room
(`broadcastStream`), or specific tokens (`streamTo`). You don't pick between "sync" and "streaming"
for a normal response — you use `syncRequest`; you reach for a streaming emitter only when you
actually need to stream. (Streaming is opt-in on the same request: `syncRequest({ ..., onStream })`
and `apiRequest({ ..., onStream })`.)

> **Cost of the regular fan-out:** each sync fan-out does one `fetchSockets()` (a Redis
> request/response; single-instance setups short-circuit). For very large rooms spread across
> instances it also does one `RemoteSocket.emit()` per remote recipient. Both are fine for typical
> rooms; if it ever becomes a bottleneck, an `io.serverSideEmit()`-based fan-out (O(instances)) is
> the optimization — no API change.

## Scaling sockets

Because socket load lives on the `system`-service backend(s):

- To handle more concurrent sockets you run **more `system` instances** — all pointing at the
  **same Redis**.
- The router binds **one URL per service** (`deploy.config.ts`) and does **not** round-robin
  across multiple instances of the same service. To run N `system` instances you put a real LB
  (nginx / cloud LB) at the `system` binding URL, or scale vertically (one bigger instance).
- Regular `syncRequest` fan-out and the streaming emitters both reach room members across all
  `system` instances (via the Redis adapter), so spreading a room's members across instances is
  fine — no sticky routing required for correctness. (Each sync fan-out does one `fetchSockets()`;
  see the cost note above.)

---

## Shared Redis is mandatory (silent-failure footgun)

Every backend attaches the adapter to **its** Redis. If two instances point at **different**
Redis servers, cross-instance fan-out **fails silently** — no error, events just never arrive.
Guards:
- **Boot-UUID handshake** (`packages/router/src/bootHandshake.ts`): writes a UUID to Redis and
  cross-checks the fallback env's `/_health` — detects "two Redis that both respond but aren't
  shared". Set `strictBootHandshake: true` to hard-fail instead of warn.
- **Explicit port required**: every `deploy.config.ts` binding URL must include a port or the
  router crashes at boot (`resolveTarget.ts:153`) — a port-less URL silently defaulting to 80/443
  is almost never intended.
- **`synchronizedEnvKeys`** (e.g. `COOKIE_SECRET`, `PROJECT_NAME`): hashed and compared across
  envs so sessions/cookies stay portable between instances.

---

## `services.config.ts` reality check

The shipped `services.config.ts` declares `vehicles` and `billing` services, but **there are no
`src/vehicles/` or `src/billing/` folders** — they are **placeholders** illustrating the
multi-service shape. The real routes live in `src/playground`, `src/settings`,
`src/reset-password`, and `src/_api`/`src/_sync` (`system`). In **dev** every route loads
regardless of preset, so this is harmless locally; for a real split deploy, make
`services.config.ts` match the folders that actually exist (add real service folders, or remove
the placeholders). `npm run luckystack-validate-deploy` flags service/preset mismatches.

---

## Pitfalls — symptom → cause → fix

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| A `syncRequest` broadcast / `broadcastStream` reaches **no one** on other servers | Instances pointing at **different** Redis (so neither `fetchSockets()` nor the adapter spans them) | Point every backend at one shared Redis (`REDIS_HOST`/`REDIS_PORT`); enable `strictBootHandshake` to catch it at boot |
| Every sync feels slightly slower / more Redis traffic in a cluster | Each sync fan-out does one cross-instance `fetchSockets()` (Redis round-trip) + one `RemoteSocket.emit()` per remote recipient | Expected; single-instance short-circuits. For very high sync throughput or huge rooms, the `io.serverSideEmit()` fan-out (O(instances)) is the optimization — no API change |
| Router **crashes at boot** with an explicit-port error | A `deploy.config.ts` binding URL has no port | Add the port (`http://host:8081/`) |
| Sessions/cookies not portable between instances (users logged out after LB switch) | `COOKIE_SECRET` / `PROJECT_NAME` differ between instances | Align the `synchronizedEnvKeys` across all backends |
| `502` `serviceNotAssigned` from the router | The route's service isn't in any running preset / has no binding | Add the service to a preset (`services.config.ts`) + a binding (`deploy.config.ts`) |
| A sync route "doesn't exist" on the socket instance | The route's service is in a different preset than `system`, but WS is pinned to `system` | Keep socket/sync routes in the `system` preset, or run a monolith preset that includes them |
| `getParsedPort()`/listen on wrong port for a 2nd local instance | `SERVER_PORT` from `.env.local` clobbered an env override | Pass the port via argv (`npm run server -- <preset> <port>`) — `getParsedPort()` wins over env |

## Verify it locally

### Automated — proves the Redis cross-instance link

```bash
npm run test:integration
```

Runs `packages/core/src/socketRedisAdapter.integration.test.ts`: two real Socket.io servers +
`@socket.io/redis-adapter` on your actual Redis. It asserts (a) `ioB.to(room).emit()` reaches a
client on **server A**, (b) `io.in(room).fetchSockets()` returns members from **both** servers
(the regular sync fan-out's cross-instance enumeration), and (c) a `RemoteSocket.emit()` from
server A reaches a client on server B. **Skips gracefully** if no Redis is reachable.

### Manual — see it end-to-end with two real backends (browser)

In dev there's no load balancer, so the browser picks its backend statically. A **dev-only**
`?backend=<port>` query param (`config.ts`; `localhost`-only, ignored in prod) lets a **single**
frontend target a specific backend instance — so two tabs can deterministically land on two
different instances on one machine. Three terminals:

```bash
npm run cluster -- 4100    # backend A on :4100
npm run cluster -- 4101    # backend B on :4101  (same .env → same Redis)
npm run client             # ONE vite frontend (:5173)
```

Open **http://localhost:5173/?backend=4100** (tab A → instance A) and
**http://localhost:5173/?backend=4101** (tab B → instance B). Each tab has its own `sessionStorage`,
so log in independently in each; go to `/playground`, join the **same room** in both, then:
- Fire **`playground/echo`** (regular sync) from tab A → tab B receives it → regular sync now
  crosses instances ✅.
- Fire **`playground/streamBroadcast`** from tab A → tab B receives the chunks → streaming crosses
  instances ✅.

> This is a DEV testing convenience, **not** production. In production the frontend is built once
> (`npm run build`) and served from one origin behind a reverse proxy / load balancer that spreads
> connections across backend instances — browsers never pick a backend themselves. `npm run cluster
> -- <port>` boots `server/server.ts` directly (no supervisor / hot-reload), sharing the `.env`
> Redis. See `scripts/cluster.ts`.
