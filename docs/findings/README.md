# Findings index

> Every AI scan / findings-set / analysis lives in a date-led subfolder here
> (`<YYYY-MM-DD>-<slug>/`), each with its own `README.md` status ledger. See
> `docs/FINDINGS_PROTOCOL.md` for the rules. This index lists them all so open
> items are never lost during a cleanup.

> All v0.7.0 product, runtime, audit, and CI publication findings are terminal. All

> **Rollups drift.** This table claimed "5 open" for type-generation (actually 0, since 2026-07-15)
> and "1 open" for scaffold-e2e (fixed the same day) until 2026-07-16. A stale rollup is worse than
> no rollup: it is what a later cleanup reads to decide what is safe to delete. Re-tally from the

> this table is a convenience.

<!--
Add a row per findings-folder, e.g.:
| 2026-07-14 | 2026-07-14-security/ | Security scan | 12 | 3 open · 9 fixed |
Rollup status = a quick tally (open / in-progress / terminal) from that folder's ledger.
