# Hosting LuckyStack

This guide covers everything you need to deploy LuckyStack from development to production.

> **Multi-instance deployments:** LuckyStack supports per-preset bundles selected at runtime via the first positional argv to `server.ts` (comma-separated for multi-preset boots; see [`docs/ARCHITECTURE_PACKAGING.md`](./ARCHITECTURE_PACKAGING.md) §10.1a). Example: `node dist/server.js billing,vehicles 4001` — loads both preset maps and listens on port 4001. Production deploys SHOULD pass an explicit preset name; no argv falls back to `generatedApis.default.ts`. For service-key-aware HTTP/WS routing across multiple backends, see [`@luckystack/router`](../packages/router/README.md).

> **Bootstrap pre-flight:** call `verifyBootstrap({ requireDeployConfig, requireServicesConfig, requireOAuthProviders })` from `@luckystack/server` after your overlay loads and before `server.listen()`. In production the check hard-fails when `RuntimeMapsProvider` or `LocalizedNormalizer` is unregistered (otherwise every API/sync request silently returns `notFound`, and error responses leak raw `errorCode` strings instead of i18n messages). Dev runs only warn so devkit hot-reload can keep working before the registry settles. See [`packages/server/README.md`](../packages/server/README.md#pre-flight-check--verifybootstrap) for the full requirements list.

> **Programmatic bind address (no env vars needed):** `createLuckyStackServer({ ip, port })` now writes the resolved bind address into `@luckystack/core`'s `registerBindAddress(...)` registry at boot. Framework code that previously read `process.env.SERVER_IP` / `SERVER_PORT` (most notably `checkOrigin` building the same-origin entry) now goes through `getBindAddress()` instead, so programmatic configuration no longer drifts from the env-derived values. You can keep using `SERVER_IP` / `SERVER_PORT` if that fits your deploy — the registry falls back to those exact env vars when no explicit address has been registered.

> **Security defaults you must know before deploying:**
> - **CORS is fail-closed.** When neither `Origin` nor `Referer` is present, only read-only methods (GET/HEAD/OPTIONS) are allowed. State-changing methods (POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE) return 403. Any non-browser caller hitting a write endpoint (server-to-server probes, `curl` smoke tests, native apps) MUST send `Origin: https://your-allowed-origin`. Add the origin to `EXTERNAL_ORIGINS` in `.env`.
> - **`/_test/reset` is fail-closed.** It requires `NODE_ENV` to be exactly `development` or `test` AND a non-empty `TEST_RESET_TOKEN`. Anything else returns 403. Production deploys should leave `TEST_RESET_TOKEN` unset; dev/test deploys should set it AND keep the URL behind a private network if at all possible.
> - **CSRF middleware** runs on every `/api/*` and `/sync/*` write. The `apiRequest` helper in `@luckystack/core/client` attaches the token automatically; non-browser callers should `GET /csrf-token` first and forward `x-csrf-token` on writes.

## Prerequisites

Before deploying LuckyStack, ensure you have:

| Requirement  | Version | Notes                                            |
| ------------ | ------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **Node.js**  | 20+     | LTS recommended (matches `engines.node` in every package) |
| **Redis**    | 6+      | Used for session storage                         |
| **Database** | -       | Your choice (see database section below)         |
| **npm**      | 9+      | Comes with Node.js                               |

### Database

LuckyStack uses **Prisma** as its ORM, which supports multiple database providers. Choose whichever fits your project:

| Provider       | Config Value   | Notes                                              |
| -------------- | -------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **MongoDB**    | `mongodb`      | Currently active in `prisma/schema.prisma`         |
| **MySQL**      | `mysql`        | Uncomment in schema, update `DATABASE_URL`         |
| **PostgreSQL** | `postgresql`   | Uncomment in schema, update `DATABASE_URL`         |
| **SQLite**     | `sqlite`       | Uncomment in schema, no server needed (dev only)   |

To switch databases:
1. Open `prisma/schema.prisma`
2. Comment out the current `datasource db` block
3. Uncomment the one for your chosen provider
4. Adjust the `id` field syntax if switching between MongoDB and SQL (see comments in schema)
5. Update `DATABASE_URL` in `.env`
6. Run `npx prisma generate && npx prisma db push`

### Installing Redis

**Windows (WSL/Docker recommended):**
```bash
# Using Docker
docker run -d --name redis -p 6379:6379 redis:alpine

# Or download from https://github.com/microsoftarchive/redis/releases
```

**macOS:**
```bash
brew install redis
brew services start redis
```

**Linux (Ubuntu/Debian):**
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install redis-server
sudo systemctl enable redis-server
sudo systemctl start redis-server
```

### Installing a Database

**MongoDB (if using MongoDB provider):**

Use [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas) (free tier available) or install locally.

> Local MongoDB installations must be configured as a **Replica Set** to support transactions.

Docker:
```bash
docker run -d --name mongodb -p 27017:27017 mongo:latest --replSet rs0
docker exec -it mongodb mongosh --eval "rs.initiate()"
```

**MySQL (if using MySQL provider):**
```bash
# Docker
docker run -d --name mysql -p 3306:3306 -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=password mysql:latest

# Then set DATABASE_URL="mysql://root:password@localhost:3306/PROJECT_NAME"
```

**PostgreSQL (if using PostgreSQL provider):**
```bash
# Docker
docker run -d --name postgres -p 5432:5432 -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password postgres:latest

# Then set DATABASE_URL="postgresql://postgres:password@localhost:5432/PROJECT_NAME"
```

**SQLite (development only):**

No installation needed. Set the datasource in `prisma/schema.prisma` to:
```prisma
datasource db {
  provider = "sqlite"
  url      = "file:./dev.db"
}
```

---

## Development Setup

### 1. Clone and Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ItsLucky23/LuckyStack-v2 <PROJECT_NAME>
cd PROJECT_NAME
npm install
```

### 2. Configure Environment

Copy the environment template:
```bash
cp .env_template .env
cp .env.local_template .env.local
```

Edit `.env` with your non-secret settings. Keep placeholder values like `ID_IN_ENV_LOCAL` and `SECRET_IN_ENV_LOCAL` in `.env`, and put real secrets in `.env.local`. **Minimum required for development:**

```env
NODE_ENV=development
SECURE=false
PROJECT_NAME=my_project

SERVER_IP=localhost

# Public origin (post-login landing, email links, CORS) is derived automatically
# in dev as the Vite dev server. Only set PUBLIC_URL in production (your domain).
# The OAuth callback uses the backend origin — dev: http://localhost:80.

REDIS_HOST=127.0.0.1
REDIS_PORT=6379

DATABASE_URL="mongodb://localhost:27017/PROJECT_NAME"
```

> Adjust `DATABASE_URL` to match your chosen database provider.

### 3. Configure Application

Edit the tracked config file:
```bash
# Edit config.ts directly
```

### 4. Initialize Database

```bash
npx prisma generate
npx prisma db push
```

### 5. Start Development Servers

**Terminal 1 - Backend:**
```bash
npm run server
```

**Terminal 2 - Frontend:**
```bash
npm run client
```

The app is now running at:
- Frontend: `http://localhost:5173`
- Backend: `http://localhost:80`

---

## Production Build

### 1. Build Everything

```bash
npm run build
```

This runs:
1. `npm run generateArtifacts` - Generates API/Sync type maps and production route maps
2. `tsc -b && vite build` - Builds the frontend to `dist/`
3. `node scripts/bundleServer.mjs` - Bundles the server

> **Overlay note:** the `luckystack/` overlay folder is loaded *dynamically* in dev
> (tsx imports the raw `.ts` files), but plain `node` cannot import `.ts` — so the
> bundler generates an entry that statically compiles every overlay file into
> `dist/server.js` and registers it via `registerOverlayLoader` from
> `@luckystack/server`. `bootstrapLuckyStack` then skips the runtime folder walk.
> Consequence: after editing anything under `luckystack/`, re-run the build — the
> production bundle does NOT pick up overlay changes from disk.

### 2. Build Output

After building, you'll have:
```
dist/
├── server.js          # Bundled Node.js server
├── assets/            # Frontend JS/CSS bundles
├── index.html         # Frontend entry point
└── ...
```

### 3. Run Production

```bash
npm run prod
# or
node dist/server.js
```

## Running on Bun

LuckyStack targets **both** Node ≥ 20 and [Bun](https://bun.sh). There is no runtime
switch, no wizard question, no config dimension — you run the same project with
whichever runtime you invoke:

```bash
npm run server    # -> Node (canonical path, via tsx)
bun run server    # -> Bun  (genuinely Bun; see "How this works" below)
```

> **Status (verified 2026-07-15, bun 1.3.14 / Windows x64):** the dev server BOOTS
> and SERVES under Bun — Redis connected, Socket.io initialized, `/livez` → `200`,
> `/_health` → `{"status":"ok",...}`. **But optional-package detection is currently
> broken under Bun** (see [Known blockers](#known-blockers-bun)), so a Bun boot
> silently loses login/sync/presence/devkit. Bun is **not production-ready** until
> that lands. Node remains the supported default.

### Verifying which runtime you actually got

This matters more than it sounds. **On Windows there is no shebang** — npm generates
a `.cmd` shim per bin (`node_modules/.bin/luckystack-dev.cmd`) that hardcodes a
`node` call. So a naive `bun run server` launches **Node** and every log line still
looks green. Measured, before the supervisor fix:

| Command | Runtime you actually got |
|---|---|
| `bun run server` (bin-based script) | 🔴 **Node** (`C:\Program Files\nodejs\node.exe`) |
| `bun --bun run server` | ✅ Bun (via a node-shim Bun injects at `%TEMP%\bun-node-<hash>\node.exe`) |
| `bun run ./file.ts` (direct file) | ✅ Bun |

The supervisor now prints the runtime it spawned the server child with, so you never
have to guess:

```
[Supervisor] Started server process (pid: 27448, runtime: bun)
```

To confirm from inside your own code, use `typeof Bun !== 'undefined'` — **not**
`process.execPath`. Under `bun --bun run <bin-script>` the child's `process.execPath`
is Bun's injected node-shim (`…\Temp\bun-node-<hash>\node.exe`), which *looks* like
Node while genuinely being Bun.

### How this works

`@luckystack/devkit`'s supervisor (`packages/devkit/src/supervisor.ts`, the
`luckystack-dev` bin behind `npm run server`) resolves the child's runtime rather
than assuming it. Bun leaves fingerprints even when it hands off to Node via the
`.cmd` shim:

```
npm_config_user_agent = "bun/1.3.14 npm/? node/v24.3.0 win32 x64"
npm_execpath          = "<abs>/bun.exe"
```

So the supervisor can tell `bun run` from `npm run`, and `npm_execpath` hands it the
real bun binary. The resolution table:

| Situation | Child spawned as | Runtime |
|---|---|---|
| `npm run server` | `node <tsx-cli> --tsconfig tsconfig.server.json server/server.ts` | Node |
| `bun run server` (we are Node via the shim) | `<bun.exe> --bun run <abs>/server/server.ts` | Bun |
| `bun --bun run server` (already Bun) | `<process.execPath> <abs>/server/server.ts` | Bun |
| `bun run server`, bun binary not locatable | — **fails loudly, exits 1** | — |

Two deliberate properties:

- **tsx is dropped on the Bun path.** Bun compiles TypeScript natively, so tsx would
  only add a redundant transpile hop — and `--tsconfig` is not a Bun flag at all.
  Bun reads `tsconfig.json` itself, which is where the scaffold's `paths` live
  (`src/*`, `server/*`, `shared/*`, `luckystack/*`, `config`).
- **It never silently falls back to Node.** If a `bun run` launch is detected but the
  bun binary can't be located, the supervisor refuses and exits 1. A green-looking
  Node boot that claims to be Bun is the exact failure this removes.

### Env semantics

`bunfig.toml` ships with `env = false` at the project root. Bun preloads
`.env` / `.env.<mode>` / `.env.local` before any user code runs; Node does not.
LuckyStack loads its own env files and relies on Node semantics, so `env = false`
makes `bun` and `node` load exactly the same values. **Keep this file.**

> `env = false` requires **Bun ≥ 1.3.3**. Note the scaffold's `engines.bun` currently
> declares `>=1.1.0`, which is looser than what `bunfig.toml` actually needs — on
> Bun 1.1–1.3.2 the setting is ignored and Bun will auto-load env files that
> LuckyStack never loads. Use Bun ≥ 1.3.3.

### Known blockers (Bun)

<a id="known-blockers-bun"></a>

- **🔴 Optional-package detection fails under Bun — all `@luckystack/*` optional
  packages silently report as ABSENT.** `packages/server/src/capabilities.ts` caches a
  **detached** reference (`const esmResolve = import.meta.resolve`). Node tolerates the
  detached call; Bun throws `"import.meta.resolve must be bound to an import.meta
  object"`, which `has()` catches and turns into `false`. Consequence under Bun: login
  (auth), sync, presence, cron, docs-ui, error-tracking and devkit are all treated as
  not installed — the server boots, serves, and looks completely green while auth and
  realtime are off. Verified on bun 1.3.14: calling it **bound**
  (`import.meta.resolve(pkg)`) returns `true` on both runtimes. Until this is fixed,
  a Bun boot is only useful for smoke-testing the HTTP core.
- **`node:repl` is not implemented by Bun** (`repl.start is not a function`). This
  affects the **framework monorepo's own** sample app (`server/utils/repl.ts`) only —
  scaffolded consumer projects ship no REPL and are unaffected. It is why
  `bun run server` cannot fully boot inside this repo.

### Prod on Bun

```bash
node dist/server.js   # canonical
bun dist/server.js    # Bun — blocked by the capabilities issue above
```

The prod bundle is plain JS, so no transpile hop is involved either way. The `prod`
script names its runtime explicitly (`node dist/server.js`) rather than hiding it
behind a bin shim. **Prod on Bun is blocked by the same optional-package detection
bug** (prod runs the same `capabilities.has()` path via `bootstrapLuckyStack`), so it
is not yet a supported deploy target.

### Not yet verified

Honest gaps — do not read these as either working or broken:

- **Prisma queries under Bun in this stack.** Prisma's docs now list Bun as a
  supported runtime (the older "experimental" note here was stale — see
  <https://www.prisma.io/docs/guides/bun>), but no LuckyStack query path has been
  exercised against a live DB under Bun. Smoke-test your hot queries before trusting
  a deploy.
- **`@luckystack/router`'s WebSocket proxy under Bun.** Untested.
- **Socket.io under sustained load / long-polling fallback under Bun.** The
  handshake + adapter attach were confirmed at boot; traffic was not exercised.
- **`prisma generate` under `bunx --bun`** — deliberately stays on `npx` (Prisma's
  CLI is a Node program; `bunx --bun prisma generate` has an open Windows hang,
  oven-sh/bun#14868).

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name your-domain.com;

    # Redirect HTTP to HTTPS
    return 301 https://$server_name$request_uri;
}

server {
    listen 443 ssl http2;
    server_name your-domain.com;

    # SSL certificates (use Certbot for free certs)
    ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/your-domain.com/fullchain.pem;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/your-domain.com/privkey.pem;

    # Proxy to Node.js server
    location / {
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:3000;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
        proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
    }

    # WebSocket support (critical for Socket.io)
    location /socket.io/ {
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:3000;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
    }
}
```

Enable the site:
```bash
sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/PROJECT_NAME /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
sudo nginx -t
sudo systemctl reload nginx
```

#### 4. SSL with Certbot

```bash
sudo apt install certbot python3-certbot-nginx
sudo certbot --nginx -d your-domain.com
```

#### 5. Production Environment

Update your `.env`:

```env
NODE_ENV=production
SECURE=true
SERVER_IP=127.0.0.1
PUBLIC_URL=https://your-domain.com

# Use production OAuth credentials
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_prod_id
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_prod_secret
# ... etc
```

---

### VPS Deployment with Caddy

Caddy automatically handles SSL certificates.

#### 1. Install Caddy

```bash
sudo apt install -y debian-keyring debian-archive-keyring apt-transport-https
curl -1sLf 'https://dl.cloudsmith.io/public/caddy/stable/gpg.key' | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/caddy-stable-archive-keyring.gpg
curl -1sLf 'https://dl.cloudsmith.io/public/caddy/stable/debian.deb.txt' | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/caddy-stable.list
sudo apt update
sudo apt install caddy
```

#### 2. Configure Caddy

Edit `/etc/caddy/Caddyfile`:

```caddy
your-domain.com {
    reverse_proxy localhost:3000
}
```

```bash
sudo systemctl reload caddy
```

That's it! Caddy automatically provisions SSL.

---

### Docker Deployment

#### 1. Create Dockerfile

Create `Dockerfile` in project root:

```dockerfile
FROM node:20-alpine AS builder

WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci
COPY . .
RUN npm run build

FROM node:20-alpine AS runner

WORKDIR /app

# Copy built files
COPY --from=builder /app/dist ./dist
COPY --from=builder /app/node_modules ./node_modules
COPY --from=builder /app/package.json ./
COPY --from=builder /app/prisma ./prisma

# Generate Prisma client
RUN npx prisma generate

EXPOSE 3000

ENV NODE_ENV=production
ENV SERVER_IP=0.0.0.0

# First positional argv is the preset bundle list, second is the listen port.
# Pass `default` (or your own preset name) plus the port that EXPOSE/k8s expects.
CMD ["node", "dist/server.js", "default", "3000"]
```

#### 2. Create docker-compose.yml

The example below uses MongoDB. Replace the `mongo` service with your chosen database.

```yaml
version: '3.8'

services:
  app:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    environment:
      - NODE_ENV=production
      - REDIS_HOST=redis
      - REDIS_PORT=6379
      - DATABASE_URL=mongodb://mongo:27017/PROJECT_NAME
    depends_on:
      - redis
      - mongo
    restart: unless-stopped

  redis:
    image: redis:alpine
    volumes:
      - redis_data:/data
    restart: unless-stopped

  # Replace with your chosen database
  mongo:
    image: mongo:latest
    volumes:
      - mongo_data:/data/db
    restart: unless-stopped

volumes:
  redis_data:
  mongo_data:
```

#### 3. Deploy

```bash
docker-compose up -d --build
```

## Troubleshooting

### Multi-Instance Deployment Notes

When you run more than one backend process (horizontal scaling, preset-split services, blue/green) behind the built-in `@luckystack/router` or any load balancer:

1. **Shared Redis is mandatory.** Every backend attaches `@socket.io/redis-adapter` at startup so room broadcasts fan out across instances. All backends must point at the same Redis (`REDIS_HOST` + `REDIS_PORT`).
2. **Split/fallback mode hard-fails without Redis.** When `environment.fallback` is set in `deploy.config.ts`, the router refuses to start if Redis is unreachable. This is deliberate — `disableSharedHealthState` is ignored in that mode.
3. **`/_health` contract.** Each backend writes a boot UUID to `luckystack:boot:<envKey>` on startup and exposes it via `GET /_health`. The router's boot handshake cross-checks this to detect the "two Redis URLs that both respond" failure mode. Your edge proxy should let `/_health` through unauthenticated (it already skips auth in the default server config).
4. **WebSocket upgrades.** The router forwards `/socket.io/?...` upgrades to the `system` service by convention. Make sure at least one backend in your deployment owns the `system` service.
5. **Sync fan-out reaches across instances.** Regular `syncRequest` fan-out uses `io.in(room).fetchSockets()` (cross-instance enumeration + per-recipient `RemoteSocket.emit()`), and the streaming emitters (`broadcastStream` / `streamTo`) use `io.to().emit()` — both span every `system` instance on the shared Redis, so spreading a room's members across instances is fine (no sticky routing needed). Each sync fan-out costs one `fetchSockets()` round-trip (single-instance short-circuits). Full model + costs: **`docs/ARCHITECTURE_MULTI_INSTANCE.md`**.

### Socket.io Connection Fails

**Symptom:** Frontend can't connect to backend, WebSocket errors in console.

**Solutions:**
1. Ensure nginx/Caddy is configured for WebSocket upgrades
2. Check `PUBLIC_URL` matches your actual domain
3. Verify `EXTERNAL_ORIGINS` includes your domain

### OAuth Redirect Fails

**Symptom:** Login redirects to wrong URL or fails silently.

**Solutions:**
1. Check OAuth callback URLs in provider dashboard match exactly:
   - Google: `https://your-domain.com/auth/callback/google`
   - GitHub: `https://your-domain.com/auth/callback/github`
   - etc.
2. Ensure `PUBLIC_URL` is set to your domain (prod) so the callback redirects back correctly
3. Use production OAuth credentials (not DEV_ prefixed ones)

### Redis Connection Errors

**Symptom:** Server crashes with Redis connection refused.

**Solutions:**
1. Verify Redis is running: `redis-cli ping`
2. Check `REDIS_HOST` and `REDIS_PORT` are correct
3. If using Docker, ensure services are on same network

### Session Not Persisting

**Symptom:** User gets logged out on page refresh.

**Solutions:**
1. Check `SECURE=true` only if using HTTPS
2. Verify `sessionBasedToken` in `config.ts` matches your intended token mode
3. Check Redis is properly storing data: `redis-cli keys "*"`

### Build Fails

**Symptom:** TypeScript or Vite build errors.

**Solutions:**
1. Ensure `config.ts` exists and contains valid project settings
2. Run `npx prisma generate` before building
3. Check all dependencies installed: `rm -rf node_modules && npm install`

### Database Connection Issues

**Symptom:** Prisma errors on startup or API calls.

**Solutions:**
1. Verify `DATABASE_URL` in `.env` matches your database provider
2. Ensure only ONE `datasource db` block is uncommented in `prisma/schema.prisma`
3. Run `npx prisma generate` after changing providers
4. For MongoDB: ensure replica set is configured if using transactions

## Quick Reference

```bash
# Development
npm run client          # Start Vite dev server
npm run server          # Start Node.js server
npm run liveServer      # Start server with hot reload

# Production
npm run build           # Build everything
npm run prod            # Run production server

# Database
npx prisma generate     # Generate Prisma client
npx prisma db push      # Push schema to database
npx prisma studio       # Open database GUI
```
