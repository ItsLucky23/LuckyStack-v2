# Changelog

All notable changes to `@luckystack/core` are documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

## [0.5.0] - 2026-07-11

### Changed

- **`@prisma/client` is now an OPTIONAL peer dependency** (ADR 0020, the ORM
  choice). npm no longer auto-installs it; scaffolded projects get it via the
  template's direct dependency when `orm: 'prisma'`. Non-scaffolded projects
  that relied on peer auto-install must add `@prisma/client` to their own
  `package.json`. The same demotion applies in `@luckystack/api`, `devkit`,
  `server`, `sync`, and `login`.
- `@prisma/client` left the static-import position in `db.ts`: the default
  resolver now lazy-`require()`s it on first access. When it is absent AND no
  client was registered, DB access throws an actionable error pointing at
  `luckystack/core/clients.ts` instead of a bare `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND` at boot.

### Added

- `isPrismaClientResolvable()` — is a generated `@prisma/client` present?
- `registerDbHealthCheck` / `getDbHealthCheck` / `isDbHealthCheckRegistered` /
  `resetDbHealthCheckForTests` (+ types `DbHealthCheck`, `DbHealthResult`) —
  pluggable `/readyz` database probe; without one the server falls back to the
  built-in Prisma ping when Prisma is present, else reports `'skipped'`.

## [0.1.5]

### Removed

- **`DNS` dropped from the env schema.** It was a reserved/legacy var that
  conflated the backend origin (OAuth callback host) with the public origin
  (where users browse). Projects now derive the backend origin from
  `SERVER_IP`/`SERVER_PORT` and set the public origin via `app.publicUrl` (see the
  scaffold's `config.ts`). Leftover `DNS=` lines in existing `.env` files are
  harmless — the schema is `loose()`, so unknown keys pass through ignored.

## [0.1.0]

### Added

- Initial public release as part of the LuckyStack package split.
