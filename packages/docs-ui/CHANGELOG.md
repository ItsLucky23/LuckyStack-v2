# Changelog

All notable changes to `@luckystack/docs-ui` are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.11.0] - 2026-10-14

### Changed

- Type declarations are emitted per source file by TypeScript 7 (`tsc -b`) instead of one bundled `.d.ts` per entry, so the framework build no longer runs package by package. The exported types are unchanged; relative imports inside the declarations carry `.js`, so `moduleResolution: "node16"`/`"nodenext"` projects resolve them as before.
- Package design guidance now ships as `AGENTS.md`, not `CLAUDE.md`. Handwritten docs focus on rationale and safety; exact API contracts remain in installed declarations/source.

## [0.8.1] - 2026-07-27

### Fixed

- Production docs exposure and error-detail gates now follow runtime mode instead of deploy-topology identity.

## [0.1.0]

### Added

- Initial public release as part of the LuckyStack package split.
