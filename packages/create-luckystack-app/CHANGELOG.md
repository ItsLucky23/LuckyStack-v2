## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.5]

### Fixed

- **AI dev-instructions scaffold option now actually works.** The framework AI
  docs (`CLAUDE.md`, `docs/`, `skills/`, `.claude/commands`, `branch-logs/README.md`)
  were copied from the monorepo root, which is absent in a published install — so
  selecting "include AI instructions" silently copied nothing. They are now
  bundled into the package at build time (`framework-docs/`) and copied from there.
- **OAuth multi-select toggle on Windows + clearer confirm flow.** The spacebar
  now toggles a provider whether the console reports it as `key.name === 'space'`
  or only as the raw `' '` string (some Windows consoles do the latter). Both
  Space AND Enter now toggle the highlighted provider, and a dedicated **"Next"**
  row at the bottom of the list confirms the step (Space/Enter on it continues) —
  so Enter can't accidentally confirm before you've finished selecting.
- **Credentials login no longer shows a false "success" when a session already
  exists.** Re-submitting the login form while signed in trips the CSRF guard,
  which replies with `{ status: 'error' }` — a truthy string the form misread as
  success (empty green toast + bounce to /login). The form now treats only a
  literal `status === true` as success and surfaces `errorCode`. The login AND
  register pages also redirect already-signed-in visitors to the app instead of
  showing the form (re-POSTing credentials while signed in is what tripped CSRF).
- **OAuth redirect now stays on the dev frontend.** The scaffold's `DNS` defaulted
  to the backend port, so after an OAuth login the browser landed on the backend
  origin instead of the Vite frontend. `DNS` now defaults to the dev frontend origin
  (`http://localhost:5173`), and a new root `/` page routes visitors to the
  dashboard (or login) instead of falling through to the catch-all error page.
- **Dashboard (and other unstyled pages) are readable.** `index.css` carried the
  leftover Vite default of white text on a white background; the `:root` defaults
  now derive from the theme tokens (and adapt to dark mode).
- **OAuth provider logos now ship.** The login form's `/<provider>.png` images were
  never included in the scaffold. They are now bundled under `template/public/`
  (google, github, discord, facebook, plus extras you can delete).
