Future Work (Not in This Plan)
Auto-generated API docs page - Like FastAPI's /docs
NPM package modularization - Split into @luckystack/*
Session storage abstraction - Support PostgreSQL/JWT
i18n error codes - Return error codes instead of messages
Offline request queue - Queue failed requests for retry
ServerFunctions interface - Fetch them automatically from server/functions folder and auto gen type


✅ Completed
HTTP API Routing - RESTful /api/{name} routes with method validation
HTTP Method Types - httpMethod in generated types + 
getApiMethod()
 runtime lookup
Simplified httpApiUtils - User reverted to include more prefixes (get/fetch/list, delete/remove, update/edit/patch)
Cleaned up server.ts - Removed legacy POST /api route, now uses 
getParams
 for parsing
Updated Documentation - 
docs/ARCHITECTURE_API.md
 reflects new routes
Fixed TypeScript errors - createPageApi removed, function overload order fixed
