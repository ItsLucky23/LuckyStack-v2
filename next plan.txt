Future Work (Not in This Plan)

✅ Auto-generated API docs page - Like FastAPI's /docs
NPM package modularization - Split into @luckystack/*
Session storage abstraction - Support PostgreSQL/JWT
✅ ServerFunctions interface - Fetch them automatically from server/functions folder and auto gen type
Location Provider - Optional feature just like socket broadcaster
✅ Theme - Built-in function to toggle theme
✅ based on dark or light theme in session use scrollbar-light.css or scrollbar-black.css

✅Routing - check if we support slugs/ids in routes for pages and if we support nested routes for (we dont want slugs in api or syncs calls since we use sockets)
1. pages
2. api, syncs
3. server functions

✅ Offline request queue - Queue failed requests for retry
✅ Completed
✅ i18n error codes - Return error codes instead of messages
✅ HTTP API Routing - RESTful /api/{name} routes with method validation
✅ HTTP Method Types - httpMethod in generated types + getApiMethod() runtime lookup
✅ Simplified httpApiUtils - User reverted to include more prefixes (get/fetch/list, delete/remove, update/edit/patch)
✅ Cleaned up server.ts - Removed legacy POST /api route, now uses getParams for parsing
✅ Updated Documentation - docs/ARCHITECTURE_API.md reflects new routes
✅ Fixed TypeScript errors - createPageApi removed, function overload order fixed
